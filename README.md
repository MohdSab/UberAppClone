# UberAppClone
This code was implemented to work as the backend of a RideSharing platform to manage driver and passenger requests.

Implemented the backend of a clone UBER app using OOP principles in Python to simulate drivers and passengersâ€™ requests for pick up and drop off while updating a monitor system of all the events and grid coordinates.

The system can also return the average distance traveled by the drivers and the requests that were fulfilled or canceled.
